# Community Health Files

The default community health files for all my repos on GitHub.

Read [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) to learn more.

Some parts are taken (with or without modification) from these repos:
